How should empty trees be handled?  Currently, the following code throws
an error when we try to print $s.

   use Lingua::Treebank::Const;
   my $s = Lingua::Treebank::Const->new->from_penn_string('()');
   print $s;

The problem is that the is_terminal function called by stringify
throws an error for nodes that contain neither words nor children.
(You'll see the same error for a tree like '(TAG )'.)

Effectively, trees like '()' and '(TAG)' are ill-formed, even though
it's possible to create them by withering non-branching trees.  Is
this the desired behavior?  If not, stringify and is_terminal and
other functions should handle empty trees properly.  If so, the code
should raise and exception as soon as an empty tree is created, so
that it can be handled by the caller in a systematic way.
